# CherryUpdater
CherryUpdater is basically a Windows application with which updates can be implemented on the Cherry Mobility 7 ", 9.7" and 10" tablets sold by Kruidvat.

Originally, the program was developed to run the Den Eds update script, with which the tablets can be updated to fill in and repair missing and malfunctioning issues in ICS (Android 4.0.3). Functions that have been developed by others have now also been included; in concrete terms, it concerns the keyboard layouts of JoJo, Josgp and Lessram. It is now also possible to use CherryUpdater only for those things, so it is no longer necessary to have the Den Eds update available to use CherryUpdater.

CherryUpdater provides a simple menu structure, similar to the one in Den Eds' script, and allows the user to track the progress of updates in a "less technical" way.

CherryUpdater is configurable, which means that the program does not have to be modified when making changes to the script of Den Eds itself.
